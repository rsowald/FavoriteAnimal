        <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>
            Red pandas can be easily identified by their unique ruddy coat color, which acts like camouflage within the
            canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white lichens.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have large, round heads and short snouts with big, pointed ears. Their faces are white with
            reddish-brown “tear” marks that extend from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. These markings could have
            evolved to help
            keep the sun out of their eyes. Their tails are marked with alternating red and buff rings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red pandas have a soft, dense woolly undercoat covered by long, coarse guard hairs. Long, bushy tails help
            these arboreal animals maintain balance and protect them from harsh cold and winds. Dense fur completely
            covers
            their feet which have five, widely separated toes and semi-retractable claws.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red pandas scent-mark territories using anal glands and urine, as well as scent glands located between their
            footpads. These scent glands on the bottom of red pandas’ feet exude a colorless liquid that is odorless to
            humans. The red panda tests odors using the underside of its tongue, which has a cone-like structure for
            collecting
            liquid and bringing it close to a gland inside its mouth. It is the only carnivore with this adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red pandas are skilled climbers, using trees for shelter, to escape predators and to sunbathe in the winter.
            Their ankles are extremely flexible, and the fibula and tibia are attached in such a way as to allow the
            fibula to
            rotate about its axis. These features make it possible for red pandas to adeptly climb headfirst down tree
            trunks.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast with other carnivores their size, red pandas have extremely robust dentition. They also have a
            simple carnivore stomach, despite their predominantly leaf-based diet. Red pandas share the giant panda’s
            pseudo-thumb, a modified wrist bone used to grasp bamboo when feeding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red pandas are the only living member of the Ailuridae family, and their taxonomic position has long been a
            subject of scientific debate. They were first described as members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae) — a
            controversial classification — in 1825, because of ecological characteristics and morphological similarities
            of the head,
            dentition and ringed tail. Later, due to some agreements in DNA, they were assigned to the bear family
            (Ursidae).
        </p>
        <p>
            Most recent genetic research, however, places red pandas in their own, independent family: Ailuridae.
            Molecular phylogenetic studies show that red pandas are an ancient species in the order Carnivora
            (superfamily
            Musteloidea) and are probably most closely related to the group that includes skunks, raccoons and weasels.
        </p>
        <p>
            While originally thought to be two subspecies, new genetic studies suggest that there are two distinct
            species of red panda: Ailurus fulgens fulgens and Ailurus fulgens styani (also known as Ailurus fulgens
            refulgens). The
            latter tends to be larger and deeper red in color than the former.

        <h2>Size</h2>
        Adult red pandas typically weigh between 8 and 17 pounds (3.6 and 7.7 kilograms) and are 22 to 24.6 inches (56
        to
        62.5 centimeters) long, plus a tail of 14.6 to 18.6 inches (37 to 47.2 centimeters).

        </p>
    </section>
    <h2>Native Habitat</h2>
    Red pandas live in high-altitude, temperate forests with bamboo understories in the Himalayas and other high
    mountains. They range from northern Myanmar (Burma) to the west Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces of China. They are also
    found in suitable habitat in Nepal, India and Tibet. Ailurus fulgens fulgens lives predominantly in Nepal and can
    also be found in India and Bhutan. Ailurus fulgens styani (or Ailurus fulgens refulgens) is primarily found in China
    and Myanmar.

    <h2>Communication</h2>
    Red pandas are generally quiet, but subtle vocalizations—such as squeals, twitters and huff-quacks—can be heard at
    close proximity. They may also hiss or grunt, and young cubs use a whistle, or high-pitched bleat, to signal
    distress. Red pandas will climb trees and rocks to escape predators, such as leopards and jackals.

    <h2> Food/Eating Habits</h2>
    Bamboo constitutes about 95% of the red panda's diet. Unlike giant pandas that feed on nearly every above-ground
    portion of bamboo (including the culm, or woody stem), red pandas feed selectively on the most nutritious leaf tips
    and, when available, tender shoots.

    Like giant pandas, red pandas grasp plant stems using their forepaws and shear selected leaves off with their
    mouths. Because red pandas are obligate bamboo eaters, they are on a tight energy budget for much of the year. They
    may also forage for roots, succulent grasses, fruits, insects and grubs, and are known to occasionally kill and eat
    birds and small mammals.

    At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, red pandas eat bamboo, bamboo shoots (when in season) and leafeater biscuits.
    They are receive enrichment treats, such as apples, grapes, bananas, blueberries and other produce.

    <h2>Social Structure</h2>
    Red pandas are solitary except during the breeding season. In human care, most breeding pairs live together
    year-round. In the wild, the home range of one animal is about 1 square mile.

    <h2>Reproduction and Development</h2>
    In the Northern Hemisphere, red pandas breed from January through March. In the Southern Hemisphere, breeding season
    extends from June through August. The rapid change in photoperiod, or day length, after the winter solstice
    initiates this breeding season.

    Mating occurs on the ground, and gestation appears to include a period of delayed implantation, which may be as
    short as 93 days or as long as 156 days. Reproduction expends a great deal of energy, so it is believed that a long
    gestation period may be the result of a slow metabolic rate. Late spring births also coincide with the emergence of
    the most tender and digestible bamboo shoots and leaves.

    Females create a nest in tree holes, hollow stumps, tree roots or bamboo thickets and line the nest with moss,
    leaves and other soft plant material. Litters typically consist of two cubs born between May and July in the
    Northern Hemisphere.

    Red pandas are born completely covered in fur to protect them from the cold environment. Newborns of the species
    Ailurus fulgens fulgens weigh 3-4 ounces (about 90-110 grams). The offspring stay with the mother for about one
    year, which is about when they are full-grown. Red pandas reach sexual maturity at around 18 months of age.

    <h2>Sleep Habits</h2>

    In human care, red pandas can be active at any time of day but are primarily crepuscular, or most active at dawn and
    dusk. On average, they spend about 45 percent of the day awake and tend to be more active in cooler weather,
    especially during the winter mating season.

    In significantly cold temperatures, red pandas can become dormant, lowering their metabolic rate and raising it
    every few hours as they wake up to look for food.

    This adaptation allows red pandas to spend nearly as little energy as sloths, which is very beneficial considering
    the low nutrition content of their diet. They also exhibit temperature-regulating behaviors, such as curling into a
    tight ball to conserve body heat and energy expenditure in the cold. Conversely, when temperatures are warm, red
    pandas stretch out on branches and pant to lower their body temperature.

    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Lifespan</h2>
    Red pandas may live as long as 23 years. They show symptoms of age at around 12 to 14 years old. While females do
    not breed after age 12, males continue to be reproductively capable.
